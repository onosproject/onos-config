# Building onos-config
In order the build the project, developers are expected to install the 
required [development tools](prerequisites.md). 

Currently, the project build and validation is driven by a top-level `Makefile`, which supports the following usage:
```bash
> make help
build                           build the Go binaries and run all validations (default)
clean                           remove all the build artifacts
coverage                        generate unit test coverage data
deps                            ensure that the required dependencies are in place
gofmt                           run the Go format validation
images                          build all Docker images
kind                            build Docker images and add them to the currently configured kind cluster
license_check                   examine and ensure license headers exist
linters                         examines Go source code and reports coding problems
onos-config-base-docker         build onos-config base Docker image
protos                          compile the protobuf files (using protoc-go Docker)
test                            run the unit tests and source code validation

```

## Building Go binaries
To build the project, simply type `make`. This will check for required dependencies, compile the Go binaries 
and then perform all required validation steps, which includes unit tests, Go code formating, Go lint, Go vetting
and license header compliance check. In future, there may be other tests.

| Note that since the build relies on Go modules, you must `export GO111MODULE=on`.
## Building Docker images
To allow deployment of onos-config in a Kubernetes cluster, the `Makefile` allows creation of two separate Docker 
images.

The main Docker image is `onosproject/onos-config`, which is the main program that acts as a server that provides 
various gRPC interfaces to application. This include `gNMI` and the `AdminService` and `DiagnosticService`. The
second Docker image is `onosproject/onos-cli`, which provides a command-line shell that can be deployed as an
ephemeral container inside the Kubernetes cluster and which provides access to the `onos` CLI commands for 
remotely interacting with the services provided by `onosproject/onos-config`.

You can build both images by running `make images`.

## Compiling protobufs
To compile Google Protocol Buffer files (`*.proto`) and to generate Go source files from them, simply run
`make protos`. Provided you changed the source `*.proto` files, this will modify the corresponding `*.pb.go` source
files. Although these files are auto-generated, developers are expected to check them in, anytime they change as
a result of changing the `*.proto` files.

> The protoc compiler is run using `onosproject/proto-go` Docker image, which has been published to remove the
need for developers to install their own protoc compiler and its Go plugin. The Makefile makes this transparent.
