# Deploying onos-config

This guide deploy `onos-config` through it's [Helm] chart assumes you have a [Kubernetes] cluster running 
with an atomix controller deployed in a namespace.  
If you dont' specify the `--namespace` in the commands 
below atomix controller must be deployed in the `default`
`onos-config` Helm chart is based on Helm 3.0 version, with no need for the Tiller pod to be present.   
If you don't have a cluster running and want to try on your local machine please follow first 
the [Kubernetes] setup steps outlined to [deploy with Helm](https://docs.onosproject.org/developers/deploy_with_helm/).

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart, simply run `helm install onos-config deployments/helm/onos-config` from
the root directory of this project:

```bash
helm install onos-config deployments/helm/onos-config
NAME: onos-config
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Nov 26 13:38:20 2019
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

`helm install` assigns a unique name to the chart and displays all the k8s resources that were
created by it. To list the charts that are installed and view their statuses, run `helm ls`:

```bash
helm ls
NAME          	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART                    	APP VERSION	NAMESPACE
...
jumpy-tortoise	1       	Tue May 14 18:56:39 2019	DEPLOYED	onos-config-0.0.1	        0.0.1      	default
```

### Onos Config Partition Set

The `onos-config` chart also deployes a `PartitionSet` custom Atomix resource to store all the 
configuration in a replicated and fail safe manner. 
In the following example there is only one partition set deployed
`onos-config-1-0`.

```bash
NAMESPACE     NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default       atomix-controller-b579b9f48-lgvxf            1/1     Running   0          63m
default       onos-config-1-0                              1/1     Running   0          61m
default       onos-config-77765c9dc4-vsjjn                 1/1     Running   0          61m
```

One can customize the number of partitions and replicas by modifying, in `values.yaml`, under `store/raft` 
the values of 
```bash 
partitions: 1
partitionSize: 1
```

### Installing the chart in a different namespace.

To install the chart in a different namespace please modify the `default` occurances in the `values.yaml` file.  
Please be aware to change also `atomix-controller.default.svc.cluster.local:5679` 
to `atomix-controller.<your_name_space_here>.svc.cluster.local:5679`.  
Then issue the `helm install` command
```bash
helm install --namespace <your_name_space> onos-config deployments/helm/onos-config
```
### Installing the chart with debug. 
`onos-config` offers the capability to open a debug port (4000) to the image.
To enable the debug capabilities please set the debug flag to true in `values.yaml` or pass it to `helm install`
```bash
helm install onos-config deployments/helm/onos-config --set debug=true
```

### Troubleshoot

If your chart does not install or the pod is not running for some reason and/or you modified values Helm offers two flags to help you
debug your chart: 

* `--dry-run` check the chart without actually installing the pod. 
* `--debug` prints out more information about your chart

```bash
helm install onos-config --debug --dry-run ./deployments/helm/onos-topo/
```
## Uninstalling the chart.

To remove the `onos-config` pod issue
```bash
 helm delete onos-config
```
## Pod Information

To view the pods that are deployed, run `kubectl get pods`:

```bash
> kubectl get pods
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
onos-config-655964cbf5-tkcfb           1/1     Running   0          52s
```

You can view more detailed information about the pod and other resources by running `kubectl describe`:

```bash
> kubectl describe pod onos-config-655964cbf5-tkcfb
Name:               onos-config-655964cbf5-tkcfb
Namespace:          default
Priority:           0
PriorityClassName:  <none>
Node:               minikube/10.0.2.15
Start Time:         Tue, 14 May 2019 18:56:39 -0700
...
```

The onos-config pods are reached through a `Service` which load balances requests to the application.
To view the services, run `kubectl get services`:

```bash
> kubectl get svc
NAME                                        DATA   AGE
...
onos-config-config           5      86s
```

The application's configuration is stored in a `ConfigMap` which can be viewed by running
`kubectl get configmaps`:
```bash
> kubectl get cm
NAME                                        DATA   AGE
...
onos-config-config           5      97s
```

And TLS keys and certs are stored in a `Secret` resource:

```bash
> kubectl get secrets
NAME                                        TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
...
onos-config-secret           Opaque                                4      109s
```

#Deploy onos-topo, CLI and Simulator. Links to all those files. 

Once you have modified the device, you can verify that onos-config handled the update successfully
by checking the onos-config logs:

```bash
> kubectl logs onos-config-onos-config-6f476ddc95-rgpgs
...

```

If the update was successful, you should be able to read the updated state of the device
through the northbound API:

```bash
> gnmi_cli -get \
    -address config.onosproject.org:443 \
    -proto "path: <target: 'device-1-device-simulator', elem: <name: 'system'> elem: <name: 'clock' > elem:<name:'config'> elem: <name: 'timezone-name'>>" \
