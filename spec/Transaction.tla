------------------------------- MODULE Transaction -------------------------------

(*
This module specifies the logic for the tranasction controller. This controller
is responsible for doing the vast majority of the processing in ÂµONOS Config.

The transaction controller processes transactions as they're appended to the
transaction log by the northbound server. Each transaction may go through up
to two phases: Change and Rollback. All transactions are initially processed
through the Change phase after being appended to the log. Once they've been
committed to the internal configuration, transactions can be rolled back by
request via the northbound server. Additionally, there are two stages through
which the transaction must progress within each phase. In the Commit stage,
the controller will validate the change and commit it to the internal
configuration, making it immediately queryable via the northbound API. Once
a change has been committed, it will be sent to the target during the Apply stage.

The transaction controller provides a few
important guarantees for processing transactions:
- Changes and rollbacks will always be committed to the configuration before 
  they're applied to the target
- Changes will always be committed and applied in the order in which they
  were appended to the transaction log
- Rollbacks will always be committed and applied in reverse chronological order
- Transactions will always be applied in the order in which they were committed
- If a transaction passes validation but is rejected by the target, the rejected
  transaction and any later changes that are pending must be rolled back
  before any subsequent change can be applied (due to the semantics of guarantee #2)

Transactions are managed externally by two operations: append and rollback.
Transactions are appended in the Change phase. Once a transaction has been
committed successfully, it can be rolled back by simply moving it to the
Rollback phase.
