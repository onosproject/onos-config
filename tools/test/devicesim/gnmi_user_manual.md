# gNMI Simulator User Manual


The configuration is loaded by default from [target_configs/typical_ofsw_config.json](target_configs/typical_ofsw_config.json)

## Create the docker image
```bash
docker build -t devicesim -f Dockerfile .
```

## Run 3 devices with Docker Compose
Run 3 gNMI devices with 
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-gnmi.yml up
```

This gives an output like
```bash
Creating devicesim_devicesim3_1 ... 
Creating devicesim_devicesim1_1 ... 
Creating devicesim_devicesim2_1 ... 
Creating devicesim_devicesim3_1
Creating devicesim_devicesim2_1
Creating devicesim_devicesim1_1 ... done
Attaching to devicesim_devicesim3_1, devicesim_devicesim2_1, devicesim_devicesim1_1
devicesim3_1  | gNMI running on localhost:10163
devicesim2_1  | gNMI running on localhost:10162
devicesim1_1  | gNMI running on localhost:10161
```

> This uses port mapping to make the devices available to gNMI clients and is the
> only option for running on Mac or Windows, and can be used with Linux too.

### Running on Linux
If you are fortunate enough to be using Docker on Linux, then you can use the
above method __or__ the alternative:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up
```

This will use the fixed IP addresses 172.25.0.11, 172.25.0.12, 172.25.0.13 for
device1-3. An entry must still be placed in your /etc/hosts file for all 3 like:
```bash
172.25.0.11 device1.opennetworking.org
172.25.0.12 device2.opennetworking.org
172.25.0.13 device3.opennetworking.org
```

> This uses a custom network 'simnet' in Docker and is only possible on Docker for Linux.
> If you are on Mac or Windows it is __not possible__ to route to User Defined networks,
> so the port mapping technique must be used.

> It is not possible to use the name mapping of the docker network from outside
> the cluster, so either the entries have to be placed in /etc/hosts or on some
> DNS server

## gNMI Command Line Interface (CLI)

To use gNMI CLI, you have two options:

1. (**Recommended Option**): you can install the gNMI CLI on your own machine using the following command and run it as an external application to the Docker containers. This option allows you to connect to any of the targets and run the gNMI CLI commands. 
```bash
go get -u github.com/openconfig/gnmi/cmd/gnmi_cli
```
2. You can ssh into any of the targets using the following command and run 
the gNMI CLI from the Docker container. 
```bash
docker exec -it <Container ID> /bin/bash
```

### Get the capabilities
```bash
gnmi_cli -address localhost:10161 \
       -capabilities \
       -timeout 5s \
       -client_crt certs/client1.crt \
       -client_key certs/client1.key \
       -ca_crt certs/onfca.crt \
       -alsologtostderr
```

If you get
```bash
E0416 15:23:08.099600   22997 gnmi_cli.go:180] could not create a gNMI client: Dialer(localhost:10161, 5s): context deadline exceeded
```
It indicates a transport problem - see the [troubleshooting](#deadline-exceeded) section below.

### Retrieve the motd-banner
```bash
gnmi_cli -address localhost:10162 \
       -get \
       -proto "path: <elem: <name: 'system'> elem:<name:'config'> elem: <name: 'motd-banner'>>" \
       -timeout 5s \
       -client_crt certs/client1.crt \
       -client_key certs/client1.key \
       -ca_crt certs/onfca.crt \
       -alsologtostderr
```

This gives a response like
```bash
notification: <
  timestamp: 1555495881239352362
  update: <
    path: <
      elem: <
        name: "system"
      >
      elem: <
        name: "config"
      >
      elem: <
        name: "motd-banner"
      >
    >
    val: <
      string_val: "Welcome to gNMI service on localhost:10162"
    >
  >
>

```


## Run a single docker container
If you just want to run a single device, it is not necessary to run docker-compose.
It can be done just by docker directly, and can be handy for troubleshooting.
```bash
docker run --env "GNMI_TARGET=localhost" --env "GNMI_PORT=10164" -p "10164:10164" devicesim
```
To stop it use "docker kill"

## Troubleshooting

### Deadline exceeded
If you get an error like
```bash
E0416 15:23:08.099600   22997 gnmi_cli.go:180] could not create a gNMI client:
Dialer(localhost:10161, 5s): context deadline exceeded
```

or anything about __deadline exceeded__, then it is **always** related to the
transport mechanism above gNMI i.e. TCP or HTTPS

#### TCP diagnosis
> This is not a concern with port mapping method using localhost and is for 
> the Linux specific option only

Starting with TCP - see if you can ping the device
1. by IP address e.g. 17.18.0.2 - if not it might not be up or there's some
   other network problem
2. by short name e.g. device1 - if not maybe your /etc/hosts file is wrong or
   DNS domain search is not opennetworking.org
3. by long name e.g. device1.opennetowrking.org - if not maybe your /etc/hosts
   file is wrong

For the last 2 cases make sure that the IP address that is resolved matches what
was given at the startup of the simulator with docker.

#### HTTP Diagnosis
If TCP shows reachability then try with HTTPS - it's very important to remember
that for HTTPS the address at which you access the server **must** match exactly
the server name in the server key's Common Name (CN) like __localhost__ or
__device1.opennetworking.org__ (and not an IP address!)

Try using cURL to determine if there is a certificate problem
```
curl -v https://localhost:10164 --key certs/client1.key --cert certs/client1.crt --cacert certs/onfca.crt
```
This might give an error like
```bash
* Rebuilt URL to: https://localhost:10163/
*   Trying 172.18.0.3...
* TCP_NODELAY set

When device names and certificates match, then curl will reply with a message like:
```bash
curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 1 was not closed cleanly: INTERNAL_ERROR (err 2)
```

> This means the HTTPS handshake was __successful__, and it has failed at the
